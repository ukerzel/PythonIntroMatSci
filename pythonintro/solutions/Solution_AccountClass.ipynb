    "Imagine we are a bank and need to establish a way for us to track the transactions with customers.\n",
    "In a very simple scenario, we need an account for each customer, that has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is associated with a customer with their name.\n",
    "* For simplicity, we only consider euros (i.e. no cents, just integer values).\n",
    "* Customers can put money into the account, withdraw money and ask for the balance.\n",
    "* The bank does not offer credit or overdraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement this as a class.\n",
    "First, think about why the above requirements are ambiguous and not sufficient (and then come up with a way to mitigate this.)\n",
    "Then, think about which cases you need to consider in your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to consider:\n",
    "* \"name\" is not detailed enough: Do we mean the full name, just the surname or the given name, any middle names? Also, depending on the culture, the concept of a name may be different from what we expect in our western world.\n",
    "For simplicity we just go with the surname as a single identifier. Obviously, this will create problems down the line, as many people share the same surname.\n",
    "* We do not have any specification for gender assignments. Ignore for now.\n",
    "* When a withdrawal is made, we need to check that:\n",
    "    * There are sufficient funds in the account\n",
    "    * The withdrawal is a positive integer number\n",
    "    * We can only withdraw the full value of the balance at most, since there is no overdraft/credit\n",
    "* When depositing money, we need to check that:\n",
    "    * The deposit is a positive integer number."
