    "We can use python in a variety of ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest is to invoke the interactive shell by just typing ```python``` on the command line. This will allways work whenever we have an python interpreter installed and we will get the characteristic prompt ```>>>```. However, it is not very convenient to use as it does not allow a rich history or editing. You can leave this shell by either typing ```quit()``` or ```CTRL+D``` (for EOF: End-Of-File). ```ipython``` is an enhanced interactive shell that is a good way to interact with python whenever we need to do so from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a python program in a file (e.g. my_program.py), we can run this program via ```python my_program.py```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another - very popular - way to use python is via Jupyter Notebooks (such as this one). The notebooks consists of separate \"cells\" where we can mix, for example, documentation or instructions (text, images), and code together with the output of the code.\n",
    "Each cell can be executed and the code in this cell is then passed to the python interpreter, executed and then the resulting output (if any) is displayed.\n",
    "This is a great way to explore and work interactively.\n",
    "However (and there is always a \"however\") - the cells have a \"state\" in which the current status is captured and, therefore, the order in which you execute the cells matters. As always: use with care...\n",

Our code would do the same, in python, it even is the same code, in other languages, we have to be more stringent.\n",
