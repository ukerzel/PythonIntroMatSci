    "In some cases, we may want to remember the state of the function. For example, we could read from a very large file: If it's very large, we cannot keep it in memory, but need to parse the content one line at the time. However, it would be very cumbersome to open a file, read one line, remember which line we have read, close the file, open the file, jump to the appropriate place, etc. \\\n",
    "Another use-case is we want to compute a long list of elements - but we do not know how many to start with. We could do this with a ```for``` or ```while``` loop (as we have done previously) and define the start and stop conditions.\n",

    "Generators provide a neat way to do this without having to decide on start or stop condition in the function and, instead, focus on the function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are defined very similarly to normal functions, the main difference is the keyword ```yield```. When we encounter the ```yield``` statement, the execution of the function is stopped, we return a generator object (instead of the value), and the current state of the function is kept\n",
