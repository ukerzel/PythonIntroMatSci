    "# Files\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental and common way to persist or retrieve information is from files.\n",
    "There are many specialised software libraries that we can use within python to work with common file types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, here we give a generic overview how to access files, read and write information. \\\n",
    "We will use a basic text file for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "To read from a file, we first need to check if it exists, then open it.\n",
    "Python provides a nice way of doing this with the ```with``` keyword. \\\n",
    "Under the hood, the ```with``` statement provides a context manager for unmanaged ressources (such as files, access to databases, URLs, etc). \n",
    "We can use it to avoid a try-except construction, and the statement also cleans up afterwards, closes the file, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with open(file_name, 'r') as file:\n",
    "    # do something with the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We note:\n",
    "* The call to ```open()``` opens the file and returns an object that we can then use. \n",
    "* We specify the path and name of the file as the first argument.\n",
    "* We open the file in read-only mode (to prevent accidental write access or because we do not have write privileges)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example reads the whole content of the file. \\\n",
    "*Note*: Remeber the comment about generators, reading the whole file works well here - but not for large file."
