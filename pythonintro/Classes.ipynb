    "# Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have approached Python in a procedural way: Starting from a long list of statements, we have introduced functions to make our code more efficient, more reusable and also cleaner.\n",
    "The functions took common datatypes, from single variables to dicionaries, as input and we could also return such entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes take this concept further and allow us to define our own entities (or objects). We distinguish between the \"class\" itself, this describes how this object looks like, which information it stores, or which functionality (defined by functions) it has. We can, informally, understand the class as a construction plan. If we want to make use of classes, we create \"instances\" of the class that then represent the actual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we may define a class \"dog\":  This class allows us to describe the dog (e.g. fur colour, it's name or race), and what it can do (e.g. bark). The instances of this class then refer to specific dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general setup of a class is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class class_name():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, <optional parameters>):\n",
    "        #... any initialisations we need to do....\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_function_1(self, <optional parameters>):\n",
    "        # ... define the function ....\n",
    "\n",
    "        # with or without return value\n",
    "\n",
    "    #... define more functions if needed ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**We notice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The class is defined by the keyword ```class```, followed by the name of the class\n",
    "* Each class needs to be initialised, this is done in the function defined with ```___init___()```. The function with a double underscore before and after the keyword is called a \"dunder\" or \"magic\" method in python. These methods are not intended to be called directly (by us), but they are typically called internally by some other method or action. In our case, this \"magic\" method is automatically called when we create an instance of this class. This initialisation function can take one or more optinal arguments. Typically, we define variables here that define the properties of our class.\n",
    "* The indicator ```self``` indicates the instance of this class. It is not a keyword as such (we could use some other word) - but pretty much everyone uses *self* to avoid confusion. We use this to refer to, e.g., the variables or functions that are part of this class.\n",
    "* A class can have one or more functions that define the functionality. They can (or not) have return values, they may operate on internal variables of the class, etc.\n",
